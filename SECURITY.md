## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly

Send an email to: **security@cyber-container-platform.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and severity
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### 3. What to expect

- **Response time**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: We'll investigate and provide updates within 7 days
- **Resolution**: We'll work with you to resolve the issue
- **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisories (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Change default credentials** immediately after installation
2. **Use strong passwords** for all accounts
3. **Enable SSL/TLS** in production environments
4. **Keep Docker updated** to the latest version
5. **Restrict network access** to the platform
6. **Regular backups** of your data and configuration
7. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity

### For Developers

1. **Input validation** - Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Authentication** - Use strong authentication mechanisms
3. **Authorization** - Implement proper access controls
4. **Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
5. **Dependencies** - Keep dependencies updated
6. **Security headers** - Implement proper security headers
7. **Error handling** - Don't expose sensitive information in errors
